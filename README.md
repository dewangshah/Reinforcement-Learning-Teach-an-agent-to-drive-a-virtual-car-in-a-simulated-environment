# Reinforcement-Learning-Teach-an-agent-to-drive-a-virtual-car-in-a-simulated-environment
Created an Agent to drive autonomously in a Virtual Environment, as part of the Reinforcement Learning Class Group Project Coursework at Texas Tech University
The main software we are using is the environment CARLA.
The main idea of CARLA is to have the environment  as server and then agents as clients.
These are the versions of softwares and libraries which we used:
Python 3.7
Keras 2.2.4
Tensorflow 1.14.0
CARLA 0.9.5
CUDA 7
